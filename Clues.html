                <h3 class="Others">THE GARDENER</h3>
                <p>
                    "I was in the garden at the time of the murder, tending to them at 3PM, 
                    before heading back inside at 7PM to go wash up and have dinner, a nice steak, with the model since she did not want to have the chef's stew. Oh and her dress was a lovely shade of red!
                    Between you and me though, no one really likes it when the chef prepares stew since he adds the most random things.. But by 8PM, I was in bed with a nice full stomach."

                <h3 class="Others">THE CHEF</h3>
                <p>
                    "I was enjoying some time with the priest in the chapel room at 4PM. 
                    By 5PM, I left to prepare dinner--A nice stew--for everyone. I made a turn to go to the saucery but the butler was there.
                    I had to get him to allow me to get a nice sauce for my stew! Can you believe it? However, at 7 PM, I had finished making it and served it.
                    Then I saw the model complain to the painter about her dress being ruined because she went to his room and slipped on red paint and she smelled terrible.

                <h3 class="Others">THE BUTLER</h3>
                <p>
                    "I was organizing the saucery at 5PM after the chef had entered and messed up the place to get sauces for his stew! Though, I could've sworn I smelled
                    the scent of delicious steak. However, at 6PM, I finished organizing all of the sauces and met up with the postman to collect the letters addressed to 
                    everyone, I delivered them all by 7PM before discovering the body when I was supposed to delivered it to him!""

                <h3 class="Others">THE MAID</h3>
                <p>
                    "I was doing laundry at 5PM. Unfortunately, I had to listen to the butler have a fuss about the saucery room. He usually gets like that since he's a clean
                    freak. He wouldn't allow the chef to touch anything in the room and prompted for him to tell him which sauce to give. By 6PM, I was done and delivered clothes
                    to everyone's room. When I got to the painter's room, he was covered in red. He assured me that it was from red paint falling on top of him so I helped him to the washroom.
                    Then I went to dinner and had the most terrible time--eating the chef's stew. I would've preferred it if he had cooked steak"

                <h3 class="Killer">THE MODEL</h3>
                <p>
                    "At 5PM, the painter asked me to come to his room! He wanted me to model for him since he had gotten new paint. However, I had refused the offer--a bit rudely to my guilty conscious--
                    since I wanted to visit the library to see the writer! As you see, I quite fancy him. However, I had a.. unpleasant conversation with him as he was heading to his room and I decided 
                    to rather spend my time with the gardener and had steak with her by 7PM since I wanted to cook something nice than eat whatever new stew that the chef had prepared. 
                    Then by 7:10PM, I went to the painter's room and slipped on red paint! Causing me to storm to the dining room and confront the painter about the red mess!"

                <h3 class="Others">THE PAINTER</h3>
                <p>
                    "At 4PM, I had awoken from my lovely nap and I saw the model be delivered a lovely new white dress by the postman. It was nice to my eyes and I decided that by 5PM, I would ask her
                    to model for me. She rudely rejected my offer! Then I went to go see the priest and instead had the idea to paint him. However, the priest was a bit red in the face as I had complimented 
                    him, which caused me to run back to my room at 6PM and spill red paint! The maid saw me and helped me over to the washroom. Then by 7PM, I went over to the dining room to enjoy
                    the newest stew by the chef! I quite like his stews.""

                <h3 class="Others">THE PRIEST</h3>
                <p>
                    "By 3PM, I was preparing a sermon for tomorrow morning until the chef had come by to give me a confession. He had been secretly stealing from the saucery. After the confession, the painter
                    came in at 5 PM and had told the chef and I that he had an idea to paint me. While he was preparing paints, the chef left to go make his newest stew and the painter looked at me before
                    saying he had an idea in his head about my face since my face had warmed up. He ran back to his room and so I stayed in the chappel before helping the postman since he's bad with directions.
                    Then I went to dinner and enjoyed the chef's stew before the model ran in and confronted the painter on his messy room."

                <h3 class="Others">THE POSTMAN</h3>
                <p>
                    "I arrived to the manor at 5:30PM! I had a few letters for everyone but I saw two people in the window arguing but I ignored it as I figured it was none of my business. I had gotten lost when I
                    entered the manor but I was helped by the kind priest! Though.. I sort of forgot where I was going! So I delivered the letters to a butler in the manor and left soon after back to the office!"
